    "content": "Frequently Asked Questions for Fall 2019 Data 100 Q. Who are the course instructors? A. The course will be taught by Josh Hug and TBA. Q. My question isn’t answered in this FAQ, what can I do? A. Preferably, phrase your question in a way that isn’t personally identifiable and file it as a new issue in this repository. We will then add a response to the FAQ, thus benefiting you and all other students with similar concerns. If it’s really something completely specific to your personal situation that can’t be addressed in a public forum, contact the instructors by email. Q. What are the official prerequisites for this course? A. The official list of prerequisites are: Data 8. CS61A or CS88 or Engineering 7. We strongly recommend either CS61A or CS88. EE16A or Math54 or Stat89A. This may be satisfied concurrently with DS100, but we strongly recommend that you finish a linear algebra course before taking DS100. Q. Will the official prerequisites be enforced? A. The official prerequisites will not be enforced in terms of enrollment. However, we expect knowledge from the official prerequisites for the course itself. We might be sending out a form near the beginning of the semester regarding the expected knowledge from the prerequisites (TBA). Q. Will attendance be required? A. Attendance will not be required, but we might have some method of incentivizing attendance (TBA). Q. On the course enrollment, I noticed that students are unable to enroll in a lab/discussions section. For the enrollment process, will students mark the “TBA” option in order to enroll and once they are accepted into the course will they get to choose a lab/discussion section? A. All students will enroll in a single lab/discussion section (the ‘generic’ 999 section), and at the beginning of the semester we will assign students to sections using some method (TBA). Q. Which course should I enroll in? A. For Fall 2019, undergraduate enrollment will be handled by the Department of Statistics under STAT C100. Q. What is the status of the L&amp;S Data Science Major and/or Minor? A. You can use the official Data001 Piazza site to ask questions about the data science major and/or minor. Q. I know that each student’s experience in the class may vary, but what do students find to be the most challenging aspect of the course? A. This varies a lot: for some it’s the programming, for others the mathematics, for others the statistical reasoning. Q. How difficult has it been for students to enroll into CS/Stat 100 in past semesters? A. We’ve been growing the course capacity to accommodate the demand. In Spring 2019, most, if not all who wanted to enroll were eventually able to do so (if not right at the start). Q. What will be the policy for final conflicts in this class; will there be an alternate final? A. We will have an alternate final (time TBA). Q. Will there be webcasts/lecture videos? A. Yes, all lectures will be captured on video and posted promptly on bCourses/CalCentral. Videos from previous years are also still available on the archived website for each year. These can provide useful complementary perspectives on a given topic, sometimes covered by a different lecturer. Note that to view those videos, you must be logged in with your Berkeley credentials into YouTube; otherwise, you’ll get an error message about the video not being available.",

    "content": "Frequently Asked Questions for Fall 2020 Data 100 Data 100 will be taught entirely remotely for the fall semester, even if campus begins allowing some in-person instruction. Q. What are the official prerequisites for this course? A. The official list of prerequisites are: Data 8. CS 61A or CS88 or Engineering 7. We strongly recommend either CS 61A or CS 88. EE 16A or Math 54 or Stat 89A. This may be satisfied concurrently with Data 100, but we strongly recommend that you finish a linear algebra course before taking Data 100. Q. Will the official prerequisites be enforced? A. The official prerequisites will not be enforced in terms of enrollment. However, we expect knowledge from the official prerequisites for the course itself. In particular, we expect students to have taken Data 8 and assume that students have mastered the content from it. Q. What is the proctoring policy given the online nature of the course? A. We will use Zoom proctoring for at least one exam during the semester (the exam(s) that we choose to proctor will be announced later into the semester). We will follow all new campus guidelines to ensure a fair setup for all students that is respectful of their individual privacy. Q. What is the alternate exam policy? A. Each exam will be offered in two timeslots, roughly corresponding to the morning and evening in Pacific Time, to accommodate for timezone differences. Everyone must be able to make one of these two timeslots; we will not be offering additional alternates to accommodate for class conflicts.",

This intermediate level class bridges between Data8 and upper division computer science and statistics courses as well as methods courses in other fields. In this class, we explore key areas of data science including question formulation, data collection and cleaning, visualization, statistical inference, predictive modeling, and decision making.​ Through a strong emphasizes on data centric computing, quantitative critical thinking, and exploratory data analysis this class covers key principles and techniques of data science. These include languages for transforming, querying and analyzing data; algorithms for machine learning methods including regression, classification and clustering; principles behind creating informative data visualizations; statistical concepts of measurement error and prediction; and techniques for scalable data processing. Goals Prepare students for advanced Berkeley courses in data-management (CS 186), machine learning (CS 189), and statistics (Stat 154), by providing the necessary foundation and context Enable students to start careers as data scientists by providing experience working with real-world data, tools, and techniques Empower students to apply computational and inferential thinking to tackle real-world problems Prerequisites While we are working to make this class widely accessible we currently require the following (or equivalent) prerequisites: Foundations of Data Science: Data 8 covers much of the material in Data 100 but at an introductory level. Data8 provides basic exposure to python programming and working with tabular data as well as visualization, statistics, and machine learning. Computing: The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs CS 61A or Computational Structures in Data Science CS 88. These courses provide additional background in python programming (e.g., for loops, lambdas, debugging, and complexity) that will enable Data 100 to focus more on the concepts in Data Science and less on the details of programming in python. Math: Linear Algebra (Math 54, EE 16A, or Stat 89A): We will need some basic concepts like linear operators and derivatives to enable statistical inference and derive new prediction algorithms. This may be satisfied concurrently to Data 100.",
